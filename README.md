#### <b> What is Langchain? 
1. LangChain is a powerful Framework that allows you to build applications using LLM's.
2. It helps you to create your own custom LLM models, and it can help you to train your own Custome data along with that it h elps you to integrate with various tools and API

#### <b> What are the main properties? </b>
1. Components: Components are the modular building block that are ready and easy to use to build useful application. Components include LLM wrappers, Prompt Template and Indexes for relevant information retrieval
2. Chain: Chain allow us to combine multiple components together to solve a specific task. Chain make it easy for implementation of complex application by making it more modular and simple to debug and maintain.
3. Agents: Agents allow LLM to interact with their environments. For example using an external API to performing a specific action.
4. Memory: Memory is refer to the various types of memory modules that stores and retrieve information during conversation.
5. Prompt Template: A prompt is refer to the input of the model. This input is often constructed from the multiple components. A PromptTemplat is responsible for the construction of the input.
